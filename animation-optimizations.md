# Animation Optimization Changes

## 1. Utility Functions Added
- Created responsive viewport utility in `utils.js` that sets different threshold values for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Added `getViewportSettings()` helper for standardized viewport configuration
- Created `useResponsiveViewport()` hook for client-side responsive animation triggers

## 2. Components Modified
- Updated core components with lower threshold values:
  - About
  - Gallery
  - Features
  - Clients
  - Blog
  - Contact
  - Footer

## 3. Key Improvements
- Reduced the `amount` value in viewport settings from 0.3 to 0.05 for mobile
- Added negative margin with `margin: "-100px 0px"` to trigger animations earlier
- Reduced animation durations from 1.0s to 0.5s for faster perceived performance
- Reduced initial Y offsets from 60px to 30px to make animations feel snappier
- Added GPU acceleration with `will-change-transform` and `gpu-accelerated` classes
- Added media queries for mobile-specific optimizations

## 4. CSS Optimizations
- Added mobile-specific CSS optimizations in `index.css`
- Applied GPU acceleration via transform: translateZ(0)
- Optimized transitions with shorter durations on mobile
- Added containment hints to minimize repaints and reflows

## 5. Performance Enhancements
- Added client-side detection for device type to optimize animation triggers
- Implemented stagger reduction (from 0.18 to 0.12) for faster child animations
- Set all animations to use more responsive spring animations (stiffness: 80)
